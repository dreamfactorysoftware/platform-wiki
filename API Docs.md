The “API Docs” tab in the DreamFactory Admin Console is live, interactive API documentation for every REST API configured in the [Services Tab](Services). 

The API Docs allow you to test the various REST API services you’ve added to the system, including URI request, request parameters, JSON and XML response, and generated events for each REST call. This is a great asset for learning the API, and for developing and debugging your applications.

In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, click on Downloads to get any of DreamFactory’s [Client SDKs](Client-SDKs) for Android, AngularJS, iOS, Javascript, Titanium, and Windows Phone. Every API call in the API Docs is exposed at application run-time to the client SDKs.
