<p>The <b>Admin Console</b> API / SDK module is comprised of two tabs, <b>Live API</b> and <b>SDK</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Live API</b> consists of Swagger-built documentation detailing the DreamFactory REST API. This view not only allows you to test the various services you have added to the system, but also shows the detailed in and out data fields, formats and parameters used in making each of the REST calls. This is a great asset for learning the API, and for developing and debugging your application.</p>

<p>The <b>SDK</b> includes all available, and fully documented, REST methods and how they can be accessed using our JavaScript SDK, which is included in the sample app on your DSP. Methods are accessed from the left-side navigation menu in this view.</p>
