The Quickstart tab provides a step-by-step path to creating your first simple application. The Quickstart instructions should be pretty self-explanatory.

Below are some important clarifying notes:

* Make sure to read the basics of [making API calls to DreamFactory](Important Information). API calls require an API key and a session token (note that session tokens are not required for guest users of your app, which you can enable in the Config tab).
* If you're using the SDKs on your local machine, make sure to [enable CORs](CORs-Configuration) in the Config tab. For development, entering * for the CORs host is the easiest thing to do. Make sure to white list specific host address(es) for production apps.
* Make sure to look at the SDK README files on GitHub if you are downloading and using any of the DreamFactory SDKs. The README files explain a few simple configuration constants you need to set before API calls will work.
