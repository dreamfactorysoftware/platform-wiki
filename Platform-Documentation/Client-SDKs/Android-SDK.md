The Android SDK is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/android-sdk).

The Android SDK includes a simple "to do list" example that shows how to make REST API calls to DreamFactory.

Instructions on the SDK are for Eclipse. [Here is the sample app converted to Android Studio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7HbmL3KHmODSTg0bG5wcmtMZGs/view?usp=sharing), for those who do not use Eclipse.
