## Prerequisites
In order to deploy your DSP to Bluemix, you'll need to do a little setup on your dev box. Below are the things you'll need to have installed before you can deploy your DSP. You'll only have to do these things once, not every time you deploy.

 1. An account on [IBM Bluemix](http://www.bluemix.net)
 1. A clone or fork of the DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; [repository on GitHub](/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core)
 1. The **cf** command line tool from [CloudFoundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/). Full instructions are here: [Installing the **cf** command line interface](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/BuildingWeb.html). Follow the instructions on that page that refer to connecting and logging in to Bluemix. You'll have to have this done before you can deploy.
