## Prerequisites
In order to deploy your DSP to Bluemix, you'll need to do a little setup on your dev box. Below are the things you'll need to have installed before you can deploy your DSP. You'll only have to do these things once, not every time you deploy.

 1. An account on [IBM Bluemix](http://www.bluemix.net)
 1. A clone or fork of the DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; [repository on GitHub](/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core)
 1. The **cf** command line tool from [CloudFoundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/)

### Installing the cf Command Line Tool
Finally, you need to install the **cf** command line tool. [CloudFoundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) provides the tools that allow you to manage your deployed applications. The full guide to installing this utility can be found on Bluemix here: [Installing the **cf** command line interface](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/BuildingWeb.html).
