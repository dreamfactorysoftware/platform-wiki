The DreamFactory Mobile Application (DMA) allows you to quickly deploy your applications to end users on mobile devices. DMA was built with Apache Cordova, also known as PhoneGap.

DMA is open source and free to use. DMA source code and build instructions are on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/mobile-dreamfactory-app), if you'd like to customize the app cosmetically or functionally to meet your own needs.

### Example Customizations

* Change the name of the application.
* Add your corporate branding.
* Change the color scheme. 
* Do not expose the connection URL to your server running DreamFactory. This way end users don't need to enter a connection URL.
