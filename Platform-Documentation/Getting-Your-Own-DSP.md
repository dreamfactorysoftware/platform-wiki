# Extending Your DSP

The DSP sports an extensive plug-in system which can be used by developers and end-users alike.

You may use any of the following ways to add additional functionality to your DSP
- Add new custom services and resources. Extensive documentation is available on the [[Custom Services]] and [[Custom Resources]] pages respectively.
- Create your own [fork of the DSP core repository](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/fork) and go nuts.
