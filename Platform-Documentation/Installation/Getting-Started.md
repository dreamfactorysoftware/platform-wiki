## Preparing Your System
We at DreamFactory strongly recommend that you develop your applications in the same environment where your DSP will be deployed. If you're going to run your application on a Linux-based operating system, you should be developing your application on a Linux-based operating system.

> True story... we know of companies that **require** developers to use locked-down Windows laptops, yet their entire site (over 100 systems) run on CentOS. It makes one wonder what differences will be discovered in the operating environments once deployed. Especially if said company has no identical test environment.

### Flavors
It's no secret that DreamFactory loves [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). It is a well-maintained and user-friendly Linux operating system that is easy to install. It can run along side other OSes and, is what we use internally and for our publicly-accessible systems.

However, [CentOS](http://centos.org) is also widely used and just as compatible. However, it is not as user-friendly as Ubuntu. If you're not scared of the Linux command line, then you shouldn't have and problem with it.

Here are some recommended distributions, in alphabetical order:

| Distribution    | Url                       | Based On      |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| CentOS 5+       | http://centos.org/        | Red Hat       |
| Debian 7+       | http://www.debian.org/    | FreeBSD       |
| LinuxMint 17+   | http://www.linuxmint.com/ | Ubuntu        |
| Oracle Linux 7+ | http://www.oracle.com/    | Red Hat ESL 7 |
| Ubuntu 12.04+   | http://www.ubuntu.com/    | Debian        |
