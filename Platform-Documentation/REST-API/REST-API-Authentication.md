### Using SSL with our API requires [SSL3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_3.0)

If you decide to use SSL access to your DreamFactory Services Platform, you will need to use SSL3.

During the app building process, you may find yourself using command line tools such as CURL, or writing code. Be sure you have chosen the correct settings/options for [SSL3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_3.0).

For instance, to retrieve your DreamFactory configuration with CURL (replace *localhost* with the URL of your DreamFactory instance if different):

```
$ curl -3 http://localhost/rest/system/config?app_name=**api_key**
{"id":1,"created_date":null,"created_by_id":null,"last_modified_date":"2014-03-11 22:46:44","last_modified_by_id":1,"db_version":"1.5.0","allow_open_registration":false,"open_reg_role_id":null,"open_reg_email_service_id":null,"open_reg_email_template_id":null,"invite_email_service_id":null,"invite_email_template_id":null,"password_email_service_id":null,"password_email_template_id":null,"allow_guest_user":false,"guest_role_id":null,"editable_profile_fields":"email,display_name,first_name,last_name,phone,default_app_id,security_question,security_answer","custom_settings":[],"lookup_keys":[],"dsp_version":"1.5.x-dev","latest_version":"1.4.0","upgrade_available":false,"is_guest":true,"allow_admin_remote_logins":false,"allow_remote_logins":false,"allowed_hosts":[]}
```

### Your API Key

Your **API key**, required in REST calls to your DreamFactory instance, is chosen by you when you create your application. It defaults to the **name** of your application.

Providing the API key along with the request can be done in one of two ways:

1. **Via Query String** Add ```?app_name=**api_key**``` to each endpoint URL

or

2. Send a custom HTTP header along with your requests. Your DSP will recognize API keys provided in the header **X-DreamFactory-Application-Name**:

```
$ curl  -H 'X-DreamFactory-Application-Name: **api_key**' -3 http://localhost/rest/system/config
{"id":1,"created_date":null,"created_by_id":null,"last_modified_date":"2014-03-11 22:46:44","last_modified_by_id":1,"db_version":"1.5.0","allow_open_registration":false,"open_reg_role_id":null,"open_reg_email_service_id":null,"open_reg_email_template_id":null,"invite_email_service_id":null,"invite_email_template_id":null,"password_email_service_id":null,"password_email_template_id":null,"allow_guest_user":false,"guest_role_id":null,"editable_profile_fields":"email,display_name,first_name,last_name,phone,default_app_id,security_question,security_answer","custom_settings":[],"lookup_keys":[],"dsp_version":"1.5.x-dev","latest_version":"1.4.0","upgrade_available":false,"is_guest":true,"allow_admin_remote_logins":false,"allow_remote_logins":false,"allowed_hosts":[]}
```

### Authentication
If your application is not part of the guest user’s role, then access to any service or data components will require authentication.
To authenticate a user, simply POST a JSON string to ```/user/session``` that takes on the following format: ```{“email":"email_value", “password":"password_value"}```
If successful, in the response, you’ll see a ```session_id``` indicating that a new session has been created.

Very Important: For all future requests to the API, you’ll need to pass the ```session_id``` as a new request header called **X-DreamFactory-Session-Token **

### Basic HTTP Authentication
Basic HTTP Authentication is supported on version 1.9. Now you can authenticate using ajax request by setting 'Authorization' HTTP Request Header.

```
var username = $('#username').val();
var password = $('#password').val();
var url = $('#url').val();

$.ajax({ 
    url: url,
    async: true,
    type:'GET',
    dataType: 'json',
    contentType: 'application/json',
    beforeSend: function(xhr) {
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic "+btoa(username+':'+password));
    },
    success: function(json){
        ...
    },
    error: function(err) {
        ...
    }
});
```

You can also authenticate using curl by including username and password in your url - 

```
curl http://username:password@dsp.example.com/rest/<service>/<resource>
```

Note for Bitnami cloud installs. You ned to edit the file /opt/bitnami/apps/dreamfactory/conf/htaccess.conf in order for the auth to be made available to PHP. To do this add the following line to this file.

```
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
```
