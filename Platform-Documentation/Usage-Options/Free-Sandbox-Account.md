To try out DreamFactory with a free hosted sandbox, go to www.dreamfactory.com and click the "Get Started" button to sign up. A free hosted sandbox is a great way to familiarize yourself with DreamFactory without having to install the software on your own cloud or on-premises server.

A free sandbox account is hosted by DreamFactory on Amazon EC2 and enables you to try DreamFactory free of charge for as long as you want. You can create as many sandbox accounts as you want, build as many applications as you want, set up as many REST services as you want, and make as many API calls as you want. 

However, sandbox accounts are for trying out DreamFactory, not for deploying your applications to production. 

As such, a free hosted sandbox has several limitations:

1. No service level agreement. 
2. No uptime guarantee.
3. No performance guarantee.
4. No server-side events and scripting.
