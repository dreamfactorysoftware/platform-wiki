To try out DreamFactory with a free hosted sandbox, go to www.dreamfactory.com and click the "Get Started" button to sign up. A free hosted account has the same capabilities as the open source DreamFactory installers but is not for deploying production applications. A free hosted sandbox is a great way to familiarize yourself with DreamFactory without having to install the software on your own cloud or on-premises server. 

Free accounts are hosted by DreamFactory on Amazon EC2. You can use your account free of charge for as long as you want. You can create as many free accounts as you want, build as many applications as you want, set up as many REST services as you want, and make as many API calls as you want. 

However, sandbox accounts are for trying out DreamFactory, not for deploying your applications to production. 

As such, a free hosted sandbox has several limitations:

1. No service level agreement. 
2. No uptime guarantee.
3. No performance guarantee.
4. No server-side events and scripting.
