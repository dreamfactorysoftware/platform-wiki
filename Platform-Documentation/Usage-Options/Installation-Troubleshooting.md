If you are experience issues with some of the services, like SQL database connection or server-side scripting, please make sure you have all of the necessary drivers installed with your DSP.
Depending on the way your DSP was installed and the hosting platform, some additional libraries, drivers or packages may be required for certain services to work properly.

Check out the [Add-Ons and Drivers](Additional-Drivers) page for a list of required drivers by service type.
