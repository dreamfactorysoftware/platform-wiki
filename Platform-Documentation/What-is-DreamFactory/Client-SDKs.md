DreamFactory is compatible with applications written in either HTML5 or native client technologies such as iOS and Android. We provide HTML5 example projects for [jQuery](http://www.dreamfactory.com/jquery-example), [AngularJS](http://www.dreamfactory.com/angularjs-example), and [Sencha](http://www.dreamfactory.com/sencha-touch-example).

As each new backend service is hooked up, DreamFactory automatically produces written documentation on the service interface, creates an interactive API browser for exploring the service manually, and generates a dynamic software development kit (SDK) for calling the service.

There are three ways to get the SDKs:

1. Go through the "QuickStart" module in the DreamFactory Admin Console. This is an introductory tutorial that walks you through creating your first application.
2. Click to download your preferred SDK in the "API /SDK" module in the DreamFactory Admin Console.
3. Download your preferred SDK from GitHub.
