### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is DreamFactory?**

DreamFactory is an open source REST API server (software). DreamFactory is installed middleware software that sits between client applications and backend data sources. 

At its core, DreamFactory provides all the run-time REST APIs you need in one place for every major SQL database, NoSQL database, and file storage system. DreamFactory also makes it easy to securely consume remote web services, including custom web services youâ€™ve written yourself. 

Instead of having to write your own REST APIs and backend security from scratch, DreamFactory does it all for you, so you can focus on building your apps and simply call the REST APIs in DreamFactory, which returns JSON (or XML) back to your client apps.
