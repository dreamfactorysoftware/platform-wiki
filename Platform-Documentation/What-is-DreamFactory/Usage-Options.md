There are many ways to try out and use DreamFactory. 

### Free Developer Environment

Sign up for a free developer environment at <a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com">www.dreamfactory.com</a>. Your developer environment is hosted by DreamFactory and lets you try out the software. It has all the same capabilities as the installed open source package (except for server-side scripting), but it's for trying out DreamFactory, not for running production applications.
