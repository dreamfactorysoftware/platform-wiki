DreamFactory is open source software - we welcome contributors! Some things you might like to help out with:

* Documentation
* New features
* Bug fixes

If you would like to contribute, we ask you to:

## 1. Clone the repository

## 2. Join the conversation

Have an idea for DreamFactory? Found a bug? We encourage you to start a conversation on the [DreamFactory Google Group] [dreamfactory-user] or to file a [new issue on GitHub] [new-issue] before writing code. Announcing what you're working on (or even just your need or pain points) starts a collaborative process to identify general solutions and helps us all avoid duplicating effort.

Let's build DreamFactory and grow our community, together. You can find other ways of joining the conversation on our [[Talk to us]] page.
