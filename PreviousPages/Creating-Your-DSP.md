<p>From the DSP dashboard each developer is able to Backup, Restore and Destroy instances. A Backup is a point in time snap shot of a DSP, for customers who have purchased DSP there are options to migrate a DSP into your private cloud or internal network.  All other backups are stored in the DreamFactory dashboard.  Restoring a DSP allows a user to restore a previous backup to any DSP instance.</p>
<p>To start the backup process select the DSP from your DreamFactory dashboard then press the Backup button.  Follow the onscreen instructions for starting the Backup.  Once the backup is complete an email will be sent to the developer's email account.  Each backup is stored for 30 days.</p>
<p>To start the restore process select the DSP instance that will be used and press the restore button.  Follow the onscreen prompts for restoring the backup.  Please Note: This is a destructive process. You will permanently lose any and all data associated (not including snapshots) with this DSP when you restore a snapshot.</p>
<p>Destroying a DSP will permanently remove the instance from your dashboard.  Once a DSP is destroyed the instance cannot be recovered and all previous backups will be permanently deleted.</p>
