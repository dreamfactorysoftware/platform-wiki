<p>The DreamFactory Services Platform (DSP) is a powerful open-source mobile services platform that provides all the back-end infrastructure required to build cutting edge enterprise applications for the desktop, tablet, or phone. All of your services are accessed through a REST interface that supports both JSON and XML documents. This style of document exchange interface is perfect for HTML5 applications or native client technologies like iOS. Here are a few of the key features provided by every DSP.</p>

<p><strong>Admin Console</strong> - Each DSP comes with a built-in admin console for managing all aspects of the DSP including applications, users, roles, and services.</p>

<p><strong>Application Hosting</strong> - A DSP can host any number of applications. Each application is similar to a mini web site. You can easily upload and manage each application's files and folders from the admin console.</p>

<p><strong>User and Role Management</strong> - The DSP takes care of user management, single sign-on, and user roles. You can define roles to control user access to applications, database tables, and services.</p>

<p><strong>SQL Services</strong> - Your DSP provides a comprehensive and secure connection to a dedicated SQL database. You have services for Create, Read, Update and Delete, as well as complex filtering and a complete suite of metadata services. The ability to query across object relationships is supported.</p>

<p><strong>BLOB Storage</strong> - Your DSP provides interfaces to all of the major BLOB storage systems including S3 and Azure BLOB. The master credentials to each service are hidden by the platform and users are granted access through single sign-on.</p>

<p><strong>External Integration</strong> - Your DSP can provision any number of integration points for external services such as email, NoSQL data, and remote BLOB storage. These services hide master credentials on the platform and can be administered by user role.</p>
