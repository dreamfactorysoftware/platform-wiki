<p>To get started, simply sign up for a <a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/user/register" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Free Trial</a>.  Once you have signed up, you can create as many DSP instances as you need.</p>
<p>Each DSP instance is a complete back-end that you can administer from our administrative dashboard.  You can create any number of applications in each DSP instance and administer users, roles, services, files, and schema for each application.  You can also import and export applications between DSP instances (for example between dev, QA, and production DSP instances).</p>
<p>When you are ready, you can install the DSP on any server of your choice, either in the cloud (AWS, Azure, Rackspace, etc.), on premise, or in a remote data center and securely develop, deploy, and manage your mobile applications.</p>
