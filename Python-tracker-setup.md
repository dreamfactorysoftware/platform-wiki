## 1. Overview

The [Snowplow Python Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-python-tracker) lets you add analytics to your [Python] [python]-based applications.

The tracker should be relatively straightforward to setup if you are familiar with Python development.

Ready? Let's get started.

## 2. Integration options

<a name="compatibility" />
### 2.1 Tracker compatibility

As a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively, Python is available in a huge number of different computing environments and platforms, from Civilization IV through [Django framework] [django] to Ubuntu One.

To make the Snowplow Python Tracker work out-of-the-box with as many different Python programs as possible, we have tried to:

1. Minimize external dependencies and third party libraries
2. Provide setup instructions

### 2.2 Dependencies

To make the Snowplow Python Tracker work with as many different Python programs as possible, we have tried to keep external dependencies to a minimum. There are only two external dependencies currently:

* [PyContracts] [pycontracts] - Python package that allows to declare constraints on function parameters and return values.
* [Requests] [requests] - HTTP library

These dependencies can be installed from the package manager of the host system or through PyPi.

## 3. Setup

<a name="pip" />
### 3.1 PyPi

The Snowplow Python Tracker is published to [PyPi] [pypi], the the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language.

This makes it easy to either install the tracker locally, or to add it as a dependency into your own Python app.

To install the Snowplow Python Tracker locally (assuming you already have Pip installed):

    $ pip install snowplowtracker

To add the Snowplow Tracker as a dependency to your own Python app, edit your `requirements.txt` and add:

```python
snowplowtracker ~> 0.0.1
```

Done? Now read the [Python Tracker API](Python-Tracker) to start tracking events.
