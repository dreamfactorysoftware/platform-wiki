<p>
DreamFactory is open source middleware that connects mobile devices like phones and tablets, to backend data (SQL, NoSQL, and file storage) with a Representational State Transfer (REST) API.</p>

<p>
The REST API allows clientâ€“server separation that simplifies component implementation, reduces the complexity of connectivity, improves performance tuning, and increases the scalability of server-side components.</p>

<p>
Device are phones, tablets, and the "internet of things" like sensors. Backend data is SQL, NoSQL, file storage, and remote web services. SQL is probably the most significant and widely implemented by enterprises, based upon recent survey feedback.</p>

<p>
The DreamFactory Services Platform (DSP) is an open source software package that provides a REST API for mobile enterprise application development. DreamFactory enables the enterprise developer to quickly hook up a wide variety of backend systems and expose these assets with a comprehensive palette of RESTful services.</p> 

<p>
We support data and metadata access to any ANSI SQL database including MySQL, SQL Server, DB2, and PostgreSQL. We provide support for a wide variety of NoSQL databases including Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SimpleDB, Azure Tables, MongoDB, MongoHQ, and CouchDB. For file storage we support Amazon S3, Azure Tables, and OpenStack Objects.</p>

<p>
The service platform provides other services for application development. User management features include password hashing, single sign-on, OAuth, Active Directory, Guest Users, and Open Registration. Application hosting includes the ability to store and run application files from any cloud storage system. Security services include the ability to control access to all backend assets through user roles and permissions. Advanced features include server side filters, events, and scripting. Lastly, we perform external service integration manually or automatically with Swagger or RAML.</p>

<p>
On the client side, all transactions use either JSON objects or XML documents. The services are compatible with applications written in either HTML5 or native client technologies like iOS, Windows 8, and Android. We provide HTML5 example projects for jQuery, AngularJS, and Sencha. As each new service is hooked up DreamFactory automatically produces written documentation on the service interface, creates an interactive API browser for exploring the service manually, and generates a dynamic software development kit (SDK) for calling the service from JavaScript, iOS, Android, and Windows 8.</p>

<p>
On the server side, our Apache License software package can be installed from the Amazon Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, Bitnami Website, VMware Marketplace, or on any Linux operating system including Redhat, CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu. We also provide a free "dev and test" version of the product available at our website www.dreamfactory.com.</p>
