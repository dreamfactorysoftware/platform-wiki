Open source web analytics powered by [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/), [Hive](http://hive.apache.org/) and [Infobright](http://www.infobright.org/).

Snowplow is a complete, loosely coupled web analytics platform that lets you capture, store and analyse granular customer-level and event-level data:

* Drill down to individual customers and events
* Zoom out to compare behaviours between cohorts and over time
* Join web analytics data with other data sets (e.g. CRM, media catalogue, product catalogue, offline data)
* Segment your audience by behaviour
* Develop recommendations and personalisations engines

Snowplow has been technically designed to:

* Give you access, ownership and control of your own web analytics data (no lock in)
* Be loosely coupled and extensible, so that it is easy to add e.g. new trackers to capture data from new platforms (e.g. mobile, TV) and put the data to new uses
