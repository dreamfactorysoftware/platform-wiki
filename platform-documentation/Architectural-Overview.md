<!-- --- title: DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; Architecture -->

The DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; (DSP) is an open-source software package that provides a REST API for mobile enterprise application development. DreamFactory enables the enterprise developer to quickly hook up, and then securely expose, a wide variety of backend systems via a comprehensive palette of RESTful services.

The platform supports access to data and meta-data from any ANSI SQL database including, but not limited to, MySQL, SQL Server, DB2, and PostgreSQL. Also supported are a wide variety of NoSQL databases including Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SimpleDB, Azure Tables, MongoDB, MongoHQ, and CouchDB. For file storage Amazon S3, Azure Tables, and OpenStack Objects are supported.

The platform provides myriad services for application development. User management features include password hashing, single sign-on, OAuth, Active Directory, Guest Users, and Open Registration. Application hosting includes the ability to store and run application files from any cloud storage system. Security services include the ability to control access to all backend assets through detailed user roles and permissions. Lastly, we can perform external service integration with URL parameters and HTTP headers.

On the client side, all transactions use either JSON objects or XML documents. The services are compatible with applications written in either HTML5 or native client technologies like iOS, Windows 8, and Android. We provide HTML5 example projects for jQuery, AngularJS, and Sencha. As each new service is hooked up DreamFactory automatically produces written documentation on the service interface, creates an interactive API browser for exploring the service manually, and generates a dynamic software development kit (SDK) for calling the service from JavaScript, iOS, Android, and Windows 8.

On the server side, our Apache License software package can be installed from the Amazon Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, BitNami Website, VMware Marketplace, or on any Linux operating system including Redhat, CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu. We also provide a free "dev and test" version of the product available at our website www.dreamfactory.com..
