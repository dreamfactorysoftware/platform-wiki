We want to make it super-easy for DreamFactory developers, users and contributors to talk to us and connect with each other, to share ideas, solve problems and help make the DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; awesome. Here are the main channels we're running currently, we'd love to hear from you on one of them:

## Google Group

[DreamFactory Google Group] [google-group]

The DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; Google Group (aka `dsp-devs`) is a good first stop for a general inquiry about DSPs or a specific support issue (i.e. trouble setting up a DSP). It's also a good forum for discussions about the roadmap or potential new functionality.

## IRC

`#dreamfactory`

We're big fans of IRC here at DreamFactory. We have a `#dreamfactory` channel on Freenode - stop by and say hi, you can even use [Freenode's webchat service] [freenode-webchat] so don't need to install anything to access it.

## Twitter

[@dfsoftwareinc] [dreamfactory-twitter]

Follow and chat to us on Twitter.

## GitHub

[DreamFactory issues] [issues]

If you spot a bug, then please raise an issue in our main GitHub project (`dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core`); likewise if you have developed a cool new feature or improvement in your DSP fork, then send us a pull request!

If you want to brainstorm a potential new feature, then the DreamFactory Google Group (see above) is probably a better place to start.

## Email

[community@dreamfactory.com] [community-email]

If you want to talk directly to us (i.e. about a commercially sensitive issue), email is the easiest way.
