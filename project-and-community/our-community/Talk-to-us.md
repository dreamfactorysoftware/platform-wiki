We want to make it super-easy for DreamFactory users and contributors to talk to us and connect with each other, to share ideas, solve problems and help make DreamFactory awesome. Here are the main channels we're running currently, we'd love to hear from you on one of them:

## Google Group

[DreamFactory Google Group] [google-group]

The DreamFactory Google Group (aka `dreamfactory-user`) is a good first stop for a general inquiry about DreamFactory or a specific support issue (e.g. trouble setting DreamFactory up). It's also a good forum for discussions about the roadmap or potential new functionality.

## IRC

`#dreamfactory`

We're big fans of IRC here at DreamFactory. We have a `#dreamfactory` channel on Freenode - stop by and say hi, you can even use [Freenode's webchat service] [freenode-webchat] so don't need to install anything to access it. Soon, this channel will be linked to our GitHub - so you can see new issues, merged pull requests and so on as they happen.

## Twitter

[@SnowplowData] [dreamfactory-twitter]

Follow and chat to us on Twitter.

## GitHub

[DreamFactory issues] [issues]

If you spot a bug, then please raise an issue in our main GitHub project (`dreamfactory/dreamfactory`); likewise if you have developed a cool new feature or improvement in your DreamFactory fork, then send us a pull request!

If you want to brainstorm a potential new feature, then the DreamFactory Google Group (see above) is probably a better place to start.

## Email

[community@dreamfactoryanalytics.com] [community-email]

If you want to talk directly to us (e.g. about a commercially sensitive issue), email is the easiest way.
