Wait 10-15 minutes after creating the Cloudfront distribution before running the following test. (As it takes a little bit for the Cloudfront setup to complete...) Now try accessing your pixel over both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` using a browser, `wget` or `curl`:

	https://{{SUBDOMAIN}}.cloudfront.net/i

If you have any problems, then double-check your CloudFront distribution's URL, and check the permissions on your pixel: it must be Openable by Everyone.

That's it - you now have a CloudFront distribution which can serve your tracking pixel fast to anybody anywhere in the world and log the request to Amazon S3 in your `snowplow-logs` bucket.

## A note on non-production environments

At the moment, the Snowplow ETL process does not have a facility for filtering out events generated by your development or test environments.

For this reason, we strongly recommend that you also self-host a second tracking pixel, to serve as a kind of `/dev/null` for Snowplow events in your development and test environments.

A couple of notes on this approach:

* You would need to configure your web application to use the correct CloudFront account ID depending on environment
* Unless you want to analyse your development or test environment, disable logging on the CloudFront distribution for your pixel

If you prefer, the Snowplow Analytics team maintains a publically available `/dev/null` tracking pixel on this account ID:
