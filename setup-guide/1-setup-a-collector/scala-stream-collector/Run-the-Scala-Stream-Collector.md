## Running

The Scala Stream Collector is an executable jarfile which should be runnable from any Unix-like shell environment. Simply provide the configuration file as a parameter:

    $ ./snowplow-stream-collector-0.1.0 --config my.conf

This will start the collector as a HTTP service and write serialized Thrift records to either `stdout` or Kinesis, depending on your configuration.

## All done?

You have setup the Scala Stream collector! You are now ready to [setup a tracker](Setting-up-a-Tracker).

Return to the [setup guide](Setting-up-Snowplow).
