## 1. Overview

The [Snowplow Lua Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-lua-tracker) lets you add analytics to your [Lua] [lua]-based applications, Lua web servers/frameworks, or from the Lua scripting layer within your games or apps.

The tracker should be relatively straightforward to setup if you are familiar with Lua development.

Ready? Let's get started.

## 2. Integration options

### 2.1 Tracker compatibility

As a lightweight, easily-embeddable scripting language, Lua is available in a huge number of different computing environments and platforms, from [World of Warcraft] [wow] through [OpenResty] [openresty] to [Adobe Lightroom] [lightroom].

To make the Snowplow Lua Tracker work out-of-the-box with as many different Lua programs as possible, we have tried to:

1. Minimize external dependencies
2. Provide setup instructions for the most popular Lua environments

### 2.2 Dependencies

To make the Snowplow Lua Tracker work with as many different Lua programs as possible, we have tried to keep external dependencies to a minimum. There is only one external dependency currently:

* [LuaSocket] [luasocket] - network support for the Lua language. Required to send events to the Snowplow collector

All other dependencies are bundled with the Lua Tracker itself - see the [`src/lib`] [tracker-lib] folder for details.

<a name="documented-envs" />
### 2.3 Documented environments

Below we provide setup instructions for the following popular Lua environments:

1. **LuaRocks** is a popular deployment and management system for Lua modules
2. **Debian/Ubuntu** for developers working directly with Lua in a Linux environment
3. **Embedded environments** for game, app and SDK developers working with embedded Lua

We expect that the Snowplow Lua Tracker should work in other Lua environments too - please [let us know](Talk-to-us) how you get on with setting it up elsewhere.

## 3. Setup

<a name="luarocks" />
### 3.1 LuaRocks

The Snowplow Lua Tracker is published to [LuaRocks] [luarocks], the popular deployment and management system for Lua modules.

This makes it easy to either install the tracker locally, or to add it as a dependency into your own LuaRocks-based app.

To install the Snowplow Lua Tracker locally (assuming you already have LuaRocks installed):

    $ luarocks install SnowplowTracker

To add the Snowplow Tracker as a dependency to your own LuaRocks-based app, edit your `rockspec` and add:

```lua
dependencies = {
  "SnowplowTracker ~> 0.1.0"
}
```

Done? Now read the [Lua Tracker API](Lua-Tracker) to start tracking events.

<a name="deb-ubuntu" />
### 3.2 Debian/Ubuntu

If your Lua app is running on a Linux box, you will need to install Lua and LuaSocket. On Ubuntu:

    $ sudo aptitude install lua liblua5.1-socket2

On Debian:

    $ sudo apt-get install lua liblua5.1-socket2

Then download the Snowplow Lua Tracker like so:

    $ git clone git@github.com:snowplow/snowplow-lua-tracker.git

Copy the `/src/snowplow` folder into your own Lua app's library folder, something like:

    $ cp -r snowplow-lua-tracker/src/snowplow my-app/lib/

Now add the Snowplow Lua Tracker into your Lua app's `package.path`, like so:

```lua
package.path = './lib/?.lua;' .. './lib/snowplow/?.lua;' .. package.path
```

Done? Now read the [Lua Tracker API](Lua-Tracker) to start tracking events.

<a name="embed-envs" />
### 3.3 Embedded environments

For embedded Lua environments, you will first need to ensure that LuaSocket is available (or installable). Here are instructions for adding LuaSocket into some popular games, SDKs and other apps which use Lua:

| **Game/app/SDK**              | **LuaSocket bundled?**      | **Installation instructions**                     | 
|:------------------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| [cocos2d-x] [cocos2d-x]       | No                          | [Installation instructions] [cocos2d-x-socket]    |
| [Garry's Mod] [gmod]          | No                          | [Port of LuaSocket for GMod] [gmod-socket]        |
| [Cheat Engine] [cheat-engine] | No                          | [Installation instructions] [cheat-engine-socket] |
| [Girder] [girder]             | Yes ([ref] [girder-socket]) | Enable the plugin from Girder Settings            |
| [Corona SDK] [corona-sdk]     | Yes ([ref] [corona-sdk-socket]) | -            |
| [LÃ–VE] [love]                 | Yes ([ref] [love-socket])   | -                |
| [Moai] [moai]                 | Yes ([ref] [moai-socket])   | -                |
| [World of Warcraft] [wow]     | Yes ([ref] [wow-socket])    | -                |

LuaSocket taken care of? Next, download the Snowplow Lua Tracker like so:

    $ git clone git@github.com:snowplow/snowplow-lua-tracker.git

Now copy the `/src/snowplow` folder into the folder for your Lua scripts, perhaps something like:

    $ cp -r snowplow-lua-tracker/src/snowplow my-app/lua-scripts/lib/

Now add the Snowplow Lua Tracker into your Lua app's `package.path`, like so:

```lua
package.path = './lib/?.lua;' .. './lib/snowplow/?.lua;' .. package.path
```

That's it! Now read the [Lua Tracker API](Lua-Tracker) to start tracking events.
