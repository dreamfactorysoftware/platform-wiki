Setting up Snowplow to work with Infobright is a five step process:

1. [Installing ICE](#install)
2. [Configuring ICE](#config)
3. [Testing ICE](#test)
4. [Setting up the Snowplow database and events table](#snowplow)
5. [Automating the loading of Snowplow data into Infobright](#storageloader)

Note: if you already have Infobright up and running, you can skip straight to [step 5: Setting up the Snowplow database and events table](#snowplow)

## 1. Installing ICE

This guide walks you through the process of installing ICE on Debian / Ubuntu, using instructions adapted from Infobright's own [DEB/RPM](http://www.infobright.org/wiki/Install_Guide_for_Linux/) and tar ([part one](http://www.infobright.org/wiki/Install_Guide/), [part two](http://www.infobright.org/wiki/Install_Guide_Part_2/)). ICE can also be run on Windows Servers and other variants of Linux: for details on how to setup ICE in those environments, please refer to the [Infobright website](http://www.infobright.org/wiki/Getting_Started/).

### Download

You can download the latest version of ICE on the [Infobright downloads](http://www.infobright.org/index.php/Download/ICE/) page. At the time of writing, the latest version of ICE was v4.0.7:

	$ cd ~/downloads
	$ wget http://www.infobright.org/downloads/ice/infobright-4.0.7-0-x86_64-ice.deb

<a name="install" />
## 1. Install

To install:
	
	$ sudo -i
	$ cd ~/downloads
	$ dpkg -i infobright-4.0.7-0-x86_64-ice.deb

## 2. Configuring ICE

### Configuration file

You need to enable the standard configuration file:

	$ cp /etc/my-ib.cnf.inactive /etc/my-ib.cnf

### Install as a service

Unfortunately, the Debian installer has some problems setting up the ICE daemon. Check for:

	$ which /etc/init.d/mysqld-ib
	/etc/init.d/mysqld-ib

If it's not there, you will have to copy support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system.

Assuming it is there, start the service:

	$ /etc/init.d/mysqld-ib start
	Starting MySQL
	..

### Secure your installation

Now we need to secure your ICE installation. Assuming you are still sudo'ed in as root, run:

	$ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/infobright-4.0.7-x86_64/bin
	$ /usr/local/infobright-4.0.7-x86_64/bin/mysql_secure_installation

And set the root password:

	Set root password? [Y/n] Y
	New password: <<Enter password>> 
	Re-enter new password: <<Enter password>> 
	Password updated successfully!
	Reloading privilege tables..
	 ... Success!    

And get rid of anonymous users:

	Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
	 ... Success!

And disable root login:

	Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
 	... Success!

Drop the test database:

	Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
	 - Dropping test database...
	 ... Success!
	 - Removing privileges on test database...
	 ... Success!

And finally reload the privilege tables:

	Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
	 ... Success!

Now exit from root:

	$ exit

And finally let's update the database used by `locate` (as our scripts depend on `locate` to find the Infobright executable):

    $ sudo updatedb

### Configure memory

ICE needs the appropriate Server Main Heap Size and Loader Main Heap Size based on how much physical RAM you have:

| **System Memory** | **Server Main Heap** | **Size Loader Main Heap Size** |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 64 GB             | 48000                | 800                            |
| 48 GB             | 32000                | 800                            |
| 32 GB             | 24000                | 800                            |
| 24 GB             | 16500                | 800                            |
| 16 GB             | 10000                | 800                            |
| 8 GB              | 4000                 | 800                            |
| 4 GB              | 1300                 | 400                            |
| 2 GB              | 600                  | 320                            |

The installer should set this automatically - to check, edit the memory configuration file:

	$ sudo vi /usr/local/infobright/data/brighthouse.ini

And check, updating if necessary, the following variables as per your available RAM:

	# ServerMainHeapSize - Size of the main memory heap in the server process, in MB
	ServerMainHeapSize=600

	# LoaderMainHeapSize - Size of the memory heap in the loader process, in MB.
	LoaderMainHeapSize=320

Note that some ICE documentation and files mention an additional "Server Compressed Heap Size" variable. This variable is obsolete - you can forget it.

If you change it, restart:

	$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld-ib restart

### Set it to survive restart

We donâ€™t need to create aliases for the various init commands, because they are already loaded from scripts.aliases. The relevant aliases are:

	alias icestop="sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld-ib stop"
	alias icestart="sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld-ib start"
	alias icerestart="sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld-ib restart"

And finally make sure that it survives reboot - you might not have to do this step:

	$ sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f mysqld-ib defaults
	update-rc.d: using dependency based boot sequencing

## 3. Testing ICE

You can test ICE using standard MySQL client tools, although note Infobright's non-standard port number:

	5029

To test using the client that comes with ICE:

	$ cd /usr/local/infobright
	$ bin/mysql --defaults-file=/etc/my-ib.cnf -uroot --password
	Enter password: <<Enter password>> 
	Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
	Your MySQL connection id is 12
	Server version: 5.1.40 build number (revision)=IB_4.0.7_r16961_17249(ice) (static)

	Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

	mysql>

Alternatively you can also test by running Navicat or another database querying tool and logging into the database that way. (We heartily recommend Navicat.)

## 4. Setting up the Snowplow database and events table

Now that you've got ICE up and running, its time to setup a database for Snowplow on it, and create the Snowplow events table in it.

We've created a bash script to do the above for you: the script is called `setup.sh` and can be found in the [Infobright storage](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/4-storage/infobright-storage) section of the [Snowplow Github repo](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow).

First, checkout the Snowplow repository and navigate to the Infobright storage folder:

    $ git clone git@github.com:snowplow/snowplow.git
    $ cd snowplow/4-storage/infobright-storage

Now run the `setup.sh` script, passing in your Infobright username and password i.e.:

    $ ./setup.sh {{username}} {{password}}

The `setup.sh` script will run the two 'sql' files in the [sql](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow) folder:

1. [setup_infobright.sql](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/blob/master/4-storage/infobright-storage/sql/setup_infobright.sql) creates the Snowplow database and creates a table in it called `events`, where the Snowplow event-level data will be stored
2. [verify_infobright](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/blob/master/4-storage/infobright-storage/sql/verify_infobright.sql) simply checks for the presence of the Snowplow database and events table in your Infobright installion.

## 5. Automating the loading of Snowplow data into Infobright

Now you have setup Infobright and a database / table in it for Snowplow data, you are ready to [setup the StorageLoader to regularly upload Snowplow data into the table] [storage-loader-for-infobright]. Click [here] [storage-loader-for-infobright] for step-by-step instruction on how.
