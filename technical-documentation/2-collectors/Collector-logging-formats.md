## Overview

Different Snowplow collectors write Snowplow data to logs of different formats.

Here we document the different formats, and show which collectors generate what. This document should be used by anyone:

1. Building a new collector, who would like to ensure it logs to a Snowplow supported format.
2. Building an ETL module, to ensure that the ETL module can successfully read the raw Snowplow logs generated by each collector, and write them to the [data structures](canonical-data-structure) used by the storage modules.
