Scala Kinesis Enrich is an [Amazon Kinesis] [kinesis] app, written in Scala and using the Kinesis Client Library, which:

1. **Reads** raw Snowplow events off a Kinesis stream populated by the Scala Stream Collector
2. **Validates** each raw event
2. **Enriches** each event (e.g. infers the location of the user from his/her IP address)
3. **Writes** the enriched Snowplow event to another Kinesis stream

It is designed to be used downstream of the [[Scala Stream Collector]].

It also supports reading raw events from `stdio` and writing enriched events to `stdout`, which is useful for debugging.

Scala Kinesis Enrich utilizes the [scala-common-enrich][common-enrich] Scala project to enrich events and the [SnowplowRawEvent][schema] for
reading Thrift-serialized objects collected with the Scala Stream Collector.
