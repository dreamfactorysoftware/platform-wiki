## 1. Overview

In order to analyse Snowplow data, it is important to understand how it is structured. We have tried to make the structure of Snowplow data as simple, logical, and easy-to-query as possible.

* **Single table** Snowplow data is stored in a single, "fat" (many columns) table. We call this the *Snowplow events table*
* **Each line represents one event**. Each line in the table represents a single *event*, be that a *page view*, *add to basket*, *play video*, *like* etc.
* **Immutable log**. The Snowplow data table is designed to be immutable: the data in each line should not change over time. Data points that we would expect to change over time (e.g. what cohort a particular user belongs to, how we classify a particular visitor) can be derived from Snowplow data. However, our recommendation is that these derived fields should be defined and calculated at analysis time, stored in a separate table and joined to the *Snowplow events table* when performing any analysis
* **Structured events**. Snowplow explicitly recognises particular events that are common in web analytics (e.g. page views, transactions, ad impressions) as 'first class citizerns'. We have a model for the types of fields that may be captured when those events occur, and specific columns in the database that correspond to those fields
* **Unstructured events**. We intend to build out support for unstructured events. (So that Snowplow users will be able to construct their own arbritary JSONs of fields for their own event types.) When supported, these JSONs will be stored as-is e.g. in a single 'unstructured event' column in Hive
* Whilst some fields are event specific (e.g. `tr_city` representing the city in a delivery address for an online transaction), others are platform specific (e.g. `page_url` for events that occur on the web) and some are relevant across platforms, devices and events (e.g. `dt` and `tm`, the date and time an event occurs, or `app_id`, the application ID).
* **Evolving over time**. We are building out the canonical data structure to make its understanding of individual event-types richer (more events, more fields per events) and to support more platforms. This needs to be done in a collaborative way with the Snowplow community, so that the events and fields that you need to track can easily be accommodated in this data structure. Please [get in touch] (Talk-to-us) to discuss your ideas and requirements

### 2.1 Common fields (platform and event independent)

<a name="application" />
#### 2.1.1 Application fields

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `app_id`        | text     | Application ID  | Yes       | Yes       | 'angry-birds'  |
| `platform`      | text     | Platform        | Yes       | Yes       | 'web'          |    

The application ID is used to distinguish different applications that are being tracked by the same Snowplow stack.

The platform ID is used to distinguish the same app running on different platforms e.g. `iOS` vs `web`.

<a name="date-time" />
#### 2.1.2 Date / time fields

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |

<a name="platform" />
### 2.2 Platform-specific fields

Currently the only platform supported is `web`. However, as we build trackers for more platforms (e.g. iOS, Windows 8) we would expect to add platforms that are specific to each of these platforms.

<a name="event" />
### 2.3 Event-specific fields

Snowplow includes specific fields to capture data associated with specific events.

#### 2.3.1 Event vendor

Going forwards, we plan to enable users to define their own events and data model associated for each event. When that is enabled, it will be possible to distinguish between events defined by different companies using the `event_vendor` field:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `event_vendor`  | text     | Company that developed the event model | Yes | Yes | 'com.snowplowanalytics' |

Note that to date, all event types have been defined by Snowplow. Also note that `event_vendor` values follow the [Java package naming convention](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html).

Snowplow currently supports (or will support in the near future) the following event types:

|        | **Event type**                                              | **Value of `event` field in model**    |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| 2.3.2  | [Page views](#pageview)                                     | 'page_view'                            |
| 2.3.3  | [Page pings](#pageping)                                     | 'page_ping'                            |
| 2.3.4  | [Link clicks](#linkclicks)                                  | 'link_click'                           |
| 2.3.5  | [Ad impressions](#ad-imps)                                  | 'ad_impression'                        |
| 2.3.6  | [Ecommerce transactions](#ecomm)                            | 'transaction' and 'transaction_item'   |
| 2.3.7  | [Social events](#social)                                    | 'social'                               |
| 2.3.8  | [Item views](#items)                                        | 'item_view'                            |
| 2.3.9  | [Errors](#error)                                            | 'error'                                |
| 2.3.10 | [Custom structured events](#customstruct)                   | 'struct'                               |
| 2.3.11 | [Custom unstructured events](#customunstruct)               | 'unstruct'                             |

Details of which fields are available for which events are given below:

<a name="pageview" />
#### 2.3.2 Page views

There are currently fields that are specific to `page_view` events: all the fields that are required are part of the standard fields available for any [web-based event](#web) e.g. `page_urlscheme`, `page_title`.

Back to [top](#top).

<a name="pagepings" />
#### 2.3.3 Page pings

There are four additional fields included with page pings that indicate how a user has scrolled over a web page since the last page ping:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `pp_xoffset_min`| integer  | Minimum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 0 | 
| `pp_xoffset_max`| integer  | Maximum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 100 | 
| `pp_yoffset_min`| integer  | Minimum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 0 | 
| `pp_yoffset_max`| integer  | Maximum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 200 |

<a name="linkclicks" />
#### 2.3.3 Link clicks

This is not currently supported: we plan to add support shortly. For details see [issue 75] (https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/75).

<a name="ad-imp" />
#### 2.3.4 Ad impressions

Currently the following ad-impression specific fields are not included in the canonical event model. We need to implement them shortly. (See [issue 129](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/129).)

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `adi_bannerid`  | text     | Banner ID       | No        | No        | -              |

| `adi_zoneid`    | text     | Publisher / website zone ID | No | No   | -              |

Back to [top](#top).

<a name="ecomm" />
#### 2.3.5 Ecommerce transactions

There are a large number of fields specifically for transaction events.

Fields that start `tr_` relate to the transaction as a whole. Fields that start `ti_` refer to the specific item included in the transaction. (E.g. a product in the basket.) Single transactions typically span multiple lines of data: there will be a single line where `event` = `transaction`, where the `tr_` fields are set, and multiple lines (one for each product included) where `event` = `transaction_item` and the `ti_` fields are set.

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `tr_orderid`    | text     | Order ID        | Yes       | Yes       | '#134'         |

| `tr_total`      | decimal  | Total transaction value | Yes | Yes     | 12.99          |
| `tr_tax`        | decimal  | Total tax included in transaction value | No | Yes | 3.00 |

<a name="social" />
#### 2.3.6 Social events

This has not been developed yet. However, the intention is to build support for the following fields for use recording social events (e.g. *likes*, *+1s*).

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `social_action` | text     | Social action performed | Yes | No      | 'like'         |
| `social_network`| text     | Social network  | Yes       | No        | 'Google+'      |
| `social_target` | text     | The object of the social action e.g. the music track liked, the tweet retweeted | No | No | 'pbz00123' |
| `social_pagepath` | text   | The URL of the page where the action occurred. This is generally the same as `page_url`, so does not need to be set | No | No | - |

<a name="itemview" />
#### 2.3.7 Item views

This has not been implemented yet. The intention is to implement the following fields:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `item_id`         | text     | Item ID e.g. SKU if item is a product | Yes       | No        | 'pbz00123' |
| `item_name`       | text     | Item name or title | Yes    | No        | 'Cone pendulum' |
| `item_displayformat`| text   | Type of item listing. Used to distinguish views of a product summary (in a catalogue page) vs a detailed view (on the product page). | No  | 'summary-view' |
| `item_rank`     | integer  | Item rank (position if there is a list of items displayed on the page) | No | No | 3 |
| `item_location` | text     | Location of the item on the web page | No | No | 'div-cat-4' |

<a name="customstruct" />
#### 2.3.9 Custom structured events

If you wish to track an event that Snowplow does not recognise as a first class citizen (i.e. one of the events listed above), then you can track them using the generic 'custom structured events'. Currently there are five fields that are available to store data related to custom events: we plant to increase this to 25 in the near future:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `se_category`   | text     | Category of event | Yes     | Yes       | 'ecomm', 'video' |
| `se_action`     | text     | Action performed / event name | Yes | Yes | 'add-to-basket', 'play-video' |
| `se_label`      | text     | The object of the action e.g. the ID of the video played or SKU of the product added-to-basket | No | Yes | 'pbz00123' |
| `se_property`   | text     | A property associated with the object of the action | No | Yes | 'HD', 'large' |
| `se_value`      | decimal  | A value associated with the event / action e.g. the value of goods added-to-basket | No | Yes | 9.99 |

## 3. A note about storage data formats

* Currently, Snowplow data is stored in S3 (for processing in Apache Hive, Pig, and / or Mahout), Redshift and PostgreSQL (for processing by any SQL-compatible analytics package).
* There are minor differences between the structure of data in both formats. These relate to data structures that Hive and PostgreSQL support (e.g. JSONs) that Redshift does not
* Nevertheless, the structure of both is similar: representing a fat table
* Going forwards our intention is to move the storage format for data on S3 from the current flatfile structure to Avro. **This** will become the 'canonical Snowplow data structure'. Other formats (e.g. Redshift, PostgreSQL etc.) will simply be 'flattened' versions of the same data. We have outlined some of our plans in [this blog post][avro-blog-post].
