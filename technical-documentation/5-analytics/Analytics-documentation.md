## Overview

Snowplow has been designed to make it as easy as possible for analysts to use whatever analysis tools they want to crunch Snowplow data.

As a result, documenting how to employ all the different possible tools to perform that analysis with Snowplow is a huge project in itself. We are just making a start now!

For more information on analytics with Snowplow, see the [Analytics Cookbook](http://snowplowanalytics.com/analytics/index.html) on the [Snowplow website](http://snowplowanalytics.com).
