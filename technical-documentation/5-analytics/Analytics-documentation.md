## Overview

DreamFactory has been designed to make it as easy as possible for analysts to use whatever analysis tools they want to crunch DreamFactory data.

As a result, documenting how to employ all the different possible tools to perform that analysis with DreamFactory is a huge project in itself. We are just making a start now!

For more information on analytics with DreamFactory, see the [Analytics Cookbook](http://dreamfactory.com/analytics/index.html) on the [DreamFactory website](http://dreamfactory.com).
